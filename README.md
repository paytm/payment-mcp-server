# Paytm MCP Server

A Python-based MCP (Model Context Protocal) server for managing Paytm payment links and transactions.

## Features

- Create Paytm payment links for customers
- Fetch all created payment links
- Retrieve transactions for a specific payment link

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Paytm Merchant credentials:
  - `PAYTM_MID`
  - `PAYTM_KEY_SECRET`
- The following Python dependencies:
  - httpx>=0.28.1
  - mcp[cli]>=1.7.0
  - paytmchecksum
  - pycryptodome
  - requests
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (a fast Python package installer and runner)
- [Claude Desktop](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) (for running and managing the server)

## Installation

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

Use the provided `setup.sh` script for automated installation and configuration:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

The script will:

1. Check for required dependencies (Python 3.12+, uv)
2. Clone or update the repository
3. Create and activate a virtual environment
4. Install all required dependencies

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@bitbucket.org:paytmteam/payment-mcp.git
   cd payment-mcp
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv pip install .
   ```

## Running the MCP Server with Claude Desktop

The server is designed to be managed and run via Claude Desktop. You do not need to run the server manually from the command line.

### Sample `claude_desktop_config.json`

Place this file in your project root or as required by Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paytm-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv path",
      "args": ["--directory", "path to project", "run", "paytm_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "PAYTM_MID": "<Your paytm mid>",
        "PAYTM_KEY_SECRET": "<Your paymt key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Update the `command` and `args` paths as needed for your environment.
- The `env` section should contain your actual Paytm credentials.

## Next Steps

1. Update the `claude_desktop_config.json` with your Paytm credentials
2. Restart the server using Claude Desktop
